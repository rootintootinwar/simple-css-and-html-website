	<p>The isolated-feature/combined-feature effect. Demonstration 3.2 is based on classic research by Treisman and Gelade (1980). According to their research, if the target differed from the irrelevant items in the display with respect to a simple feature such as color, observers could quickly detect the target. In fact, they could detect this target just as fast when it was presented in an array of 24 items as when it was presented in an array of only 3 items (Geng & Behrmann, 2003; Styles, 2006; Treisman, 1993; Treisman & Gelade, 1980).</p>
